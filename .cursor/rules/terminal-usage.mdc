# Terminal Usage Guidelines

## Development Server Management

When working with development servers or long-running processes:

1. **Do NOT create persistent background terminals** for development servers using `is_background: true`
2. **Use existing terminal context** when available - check for `<last_terminal_cwd>` in the conversation
3. **Reference existing running processes** instead of starting new ones
4. **Prefer one-time commands** for testing and verification

## When to Use Background Processes

Only use `is_background: true` for:
- Build processes that complete and exit
- One-time setup scripts
- Database migrations
- Asset generation

## Development Server Best Practices

- If a dev server is already running (indicated in context), reference it instead of starting a new one
- Use commands like `curl` or `bunx` for testing endpoints rather than spinning up new servers
- When checking if the server is working, use non-persistent commands
- Let the user manage their own development server lifecycle

## Example: Testing Implementation

Instead of:
```bash
bun run dev  # with is_background: true
```

Use:
```bash
bunx tsc --noEmit  # Check for TypeScript errors
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health  # Test if server is running
```

This approach respects the user's existing development environment and avoids terminal conflicts.
