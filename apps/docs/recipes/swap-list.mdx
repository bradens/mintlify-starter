To get a list of swaps for a token, you can use the `getTokenEvents` query.


To get a list of swaps for the WBNB token on the BNB chain (networkId 56), you can use the following query:

```typescript
  const doc = graphql`
    query {
      getTokenEvents(
        input: {
          tokenAddress: "0xbb4cdb9cbd36b01bd1cbaebf2de08d9173bc095c"
          networkId: 56
        }
      ) {
        events {
          ... on SwapEvent {
            id
            tokenAddress
            networkId
            timestamp
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `
  const { data } = await client.query(doc);
  console.log(data);
```

To get more (paginate), you can use the `cursor` argument to get the next page of results.
