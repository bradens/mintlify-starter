title: "Build With Codex"
---

You have two options for building on the Codex API:

| Option 1: _SDK_ (recommended)                | Option 2: _GraphQL API_                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Thin wrapper around the API                  | More customizable depending on your use case |
| Designed to get you started on Codex quickly | Requires more configuration                  |
| Built-in websocket connection handling       | More control over the connections            |
| Predefined queries and mutations             | Write your own queries                       |
| Good choice if you're using Typescript       | Good choice if you're not using Typescript   |
