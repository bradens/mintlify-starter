You can build on the Codex API via the typescript SDK or by the GraphQL API. The option you choose really depends on what language
you're using, and if you want control over the connections. The Codex SDK is a thin wrapper that gives you
types, websocket connection handling, and some predefined queries and mutations.

  The [Codex Typescript SDK](https://github.com/codex-data/sdk) is a library that makes it easy to make calls to the Codex API.

  In this documentation, you'll see examples and code snippets for both the `sdk` and other implementations.

  ## Installation

  ```bash
  npm install @codex-data/sdk
  ```

  ```typescript
  import { Codex } from "@codex-data/sdk";

  const sdk = new Codex({
    apiKey: "<your api key>",
  });
  ```

  <Accordion title="GraphQL">
