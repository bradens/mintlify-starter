| `amount0In` → String | The amount of `token0` that was sold. Only applicable for UniswapV2 events. |
| `amount0Out` → String | The amount of `token0` that was bought. Only applicable for UniswapV2 events. |
| `amount1` → String | The amount of `token1` involved in the swap. Only applicable for UniswapV3 events. |

| `amount1Out` → String | The amount of `token1` that was bought. Only applicable for UniswapV2 events. |
| `amountNonLiquidityToken` → String | The amount of `quoteToken` involved in the swap. For example, if `quoteToken` is USDC for a USDC/WETH pair, `amountNonLiquidityToken` would be the amount of USDC involved in the swap. |
| `priceBaseToken` → String | The price per `quoteToken` at the time of the swap in the network's base token. For example, if `quoteToken` is USDC for a USDC/WETH pair on ETH network, `priceBaseToken` would the price of USDC in ETH. |
| `priceBaseTokenTotal` → String | The total amount of `quoteToken` involved in the swap in the network's base token (`amountNonLiquidityToken` x `priceBaseToken`). |
| `priceUsd` → String | The price per `quoteToken` at the time of the swap in USD. For example, if `quoteToken` is USDC for a USDC/WETH pair on ETH network, `priceBaseToken` would the price of USDC in USD ($1.00). |
