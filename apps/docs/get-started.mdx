### Authentication

The Codex API is authenticated using an API key. You can get your API key from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.codex.io).

After you've got your API key, you can use it to make requests to the Codex API.

For example, you can test your api key by running the following in your terminal, after replacing `<your-api-key>` with your actual api key.

```bash curl
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: <your-api-key>" \
  -d '{"query": "{ getNetworks { id, name } }"}' \
  https://graph.codex.io/graphql
```
