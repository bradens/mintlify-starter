### Fields

<ResponseField name="amount0" type="String">
  The amount of `token0` involved in the swap. Only applicable for UniswapV3 events.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="amount0In" type="String">
  The amount of `token0` that was sold. Only applicable for UniswapV2 events.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="amount0Out" type="String">
  The amount of `token0` that was bought. Only applicable for UniswapV2 events.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="amount1" type="String">
  The amount of `token1` involved in the swap. Only applicable for UniswapV3 events.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="amount1In" type="String">
  The amount of `token1` that was sold. Only applicable for UniswapV2 events.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="amount1Out" type="String">
  The amount of `token1` that was bought. Only applicable for UniswapV2 events.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="amountNonLiquidityToken" type="String">
  The amount of `quoteToken` involved in the swap. For example, if `quoteToken` is USDC for a USDC/WETH pair, `amountNonLiquidityToken` would be the amount of USDC involved in the swap.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="priceBaseToken" type="String">
  The price per `quoteToken` at the time of the swap in the network&#39;s base token. For example, if `quoteToken` is USDC for a USDC/WETH pair on ETH network, `priceBaseToken` would the price of USDC in ETH.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="priceBaseTokenTotal" type="String">
  The total amount of `quoteToken` involved in the swap in the network&#39;s base token (`amountNonLiquidityToken` x `priceBaseToken`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="priceUsd" type="String">
  The price per `quoteToken` at the time of the swap in USD. For example, if `quoteToken` is USDC for a USDC/WETH pair on ETH network, `priceBaseToken` would the price of USDC in USD ($1.00).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="priceUsdTotal" type="String">
  The total amount of `quoteToken` involved in the swap in USD (`amountNonLiquidityToken` x `priceUsd`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tick" type="String">
  The tick index that the swap occurred in. Only applicable for UniswapV3 events.
</ResponseField>

<a href="/api-reference/types/eventtype">
  <ResponseField name="type" type="EventType!" required>
    The type of token event, `Swap`.
  </ResponseField>
