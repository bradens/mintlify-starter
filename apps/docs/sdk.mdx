The [Codex Typescript SDK](https://github.com/codex-data/sdk) is a library that makes it easy to make calls to the Codex API.

In this documentation, you'll see examples and code snippets for both the `sdk` and other implementations.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @codex-data/sdk
```

```typescript
import { Codex } from "@codex-data/sdk";

const sdk = new Codex({
  apiKey: "<your api key>",
});
```
